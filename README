# oEmbed for .net
Written in C#, this should make using oEmbed as simple as possible. Any feedback welcome.
Look at oEmbed.com for details of the standard.

##Requirements
You'll need .NET Framework 3.5 or later to use the precompiled binaries. To build the code, you'll need Visual Studio 2010.

##Instructions
I'm currently working on this. I'll upload as soon as I can.
